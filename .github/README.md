<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Breathe AmAIRica is a 3-person group project that required the developers to self-teach a non-explicitly taught technology and build an API-consuming multi-page site in one week.
We chose Typescript and React Hooks, and to employ these techs by creating and debugging an Air Quality and Weather app for American cities. We were inspired by this recent summer's wildfires, allergies, and the pertinence of air quality and weather data in our climate-changing world. 

Users can view the air quality and weather information for American cities either by the search bar, or by perusing the home page for popular destination cities or cities with positive air quality rankings. Users can view a forecast of the coming week, and click the external links to read in-depth health, safety, and travel articles. 

Time and free API calls were a hinderance, and our app is simply a proof of concept. If we had more time or more access to API data, we would have implemented allergy, pollen, and wildfire API data, and more information about which activities the user can partake in response to the current conditions.

### Built With
React Hooks
Typescript
SCSS
TDD with Jest

## Getting Started

Otherwise, fork and clone down the repo. 

### Prerequisites

Once you have locally cloned down the repo, within that file, run 
`npm i`
Once all dependencies are installed, run
`npm start`
